## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of creativity and intellect.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222), almost black, creating a strong contrast with the primary color and ensuring readability.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF00FF), used sparingly for interactive elements and highlights to draw attention and add a touch of flair.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern and clean look. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a geometric sans-serif, for headlines to match a contemporary aesthetic.
- Use clean and minimalistic icons that match the geometric style of the typography, to improve usability and understanding of the portfolio sections.
- Employ a modern, full-screen layout with a strong focus on visual hierarchy. Use negative space effectively to create a sense of balance and prevent the page from feeling cluttered.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions, hovers, and loading effects to create an engaging and interactive user experience.
